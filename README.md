# musicLibraryDB
Database schema and supporting documents for a music library database to track the band (or chorus) music

## To do:
- Write documentation
- Improve user experience
- Provide installation instructions
- Promote

## Notes:
- The Grade level (1-7) slider does actually work. You just can't see exactly what number it's set at.
